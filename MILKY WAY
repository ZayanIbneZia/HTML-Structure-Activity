    The Milky Way Galaxy is the spiral-shaped galaxy that contains our solar system. It is part of a collection of
    billions
    of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter held together by gravity. The Milky Way spans about 100,000 light-years in
    diameter
    and is home to hundreds of billions of stars, including our Sun, which is located in one of its spiral arms, known
    as
    the Orion Arm.

    At the center of the Milky Way lies a supermassive black hole, called Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). The galaxy gets its
    name
    from the milky appearance it creates in the night sky, a result of the dense band of stars visible from Earth.
